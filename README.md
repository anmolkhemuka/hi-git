# hi-git

Guideline to run code:<br>
● If python3 is not installed then make sure to install it.<br>
● The Python file is in the zip along with the CSV file make sure that CSV file is in
the same directory as the Python file.<br>
● I have also used python libraries pandas and sockets, so make sure they are present in your
system else download them by running the following commands:<br>
    1) pip install pandas<br>
    2) Don't worry about the socket it's already included in the standard library.<br>
●Run the script by typing python3 top3.py.<br>
● Wait for the file to run and it writes the result into a separate csv file in the same directory.
