Guideline to run code:
● If python3 is not installed then make sure to install it.
● The Python file is in the zip along with the CSV file make sure that CSV file is in
the same directory as the Python file.
● I have also used python libraries pandas and sockets, so make sure they are present in your
system else download them by running the following commands:
1) pip install pandas
2) Don't worry about the socket it's already included in the standard library.
●Run the script by typing python3 top3.py.
● Wait for the file to run and it writes the result into a separate csv file in the same directory.
